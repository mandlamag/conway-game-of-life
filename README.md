# OzowSorter

Foobar is a C# console program that takes any arbitrary piece of text as input, and returns as
output a sorted list of letters. Punctuation should be ignored, and uppercase
letters should be mapped to lowercase..

### Example
```bash
input: Contrary to popular belief, the pink unicorn flies east. 
output: aaabcceeeeeffhiiiiklllnnnnooooppprrrrssttttuuy
```
